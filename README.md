Android Text Repeater Demo App

App created in Android Studio 3.0.1 and tested on a Genymotion Google Nexus 5X Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Text Repeater Demo' app icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a title ('Text Repeater Demo')on the top. Then right below two editText lines for entering in data. The top line
has a hint labeled 'Text to Repeat' and the line right under has a hint labeled 'Number to Repeat'. As the user clicks the line
a typewriter pops up for that line type. The top line shows a regular typewriter, where the line under is a number keypad.

The user then enters in the text they wish to repeat then under how many times and clicks the 'Engage' button. The text is displayed
right below in the number of lines they requested.
